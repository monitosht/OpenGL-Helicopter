# OpenGL-Helicopter
 A simple game where the player can fly a helicopter through an environment. Developed in C, this project uses OpenGL to render 3D models, animate objects, and process user inputs in order to move the camera and helicopter.

# Instructions
 Use the `WASD` keys to move the helicopter.
 
 Use the `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` keys to move the helicopter higher or lower.
 
 Use the `Left Arrow` and `Right Arrow` keys to rotate the helicopter and the camera.
